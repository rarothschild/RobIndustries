The concept of the site was to have a place where roommates and landlords can communicate about expenses, stay informed about any maintenance, and keep documentation in an organized place. I've had good and bad living situations, and the bad typically happen due to renting from a property management company. The times I've rented under these I found there to be little to no human interaction, and minimal accountability. I'd like to give renters and small landlords a leg up by providing an interface for them to make record keeping and coordination simpler.

This site was the first one I made where I had a frontend and backend working together. I wrote the backend in Django, since using Python is appealing to me for it's math and analytics usage that I'm already used to. For the front end I decided to use Solid, I did this since it seems to have some key performance advantages over React. Even though it is relatively new and less documented than React I found it to be very intuitive.

The frontend was built before Londonderry Quarry so it's pretty primitive in terms of how it's structured. When I return to this project a big update is in order. It's built using tailwind, the CSS framework that I'm pretty sure I will use for the rest of my life if I can.
