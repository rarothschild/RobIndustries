This was the very first foray in designing, building, and deploying a website for a customer. It ened up being a great expirience into frontend design and general website knowledge. I used Astro JS as the frontend framework, primarily to get used to some of the newset tools available. It did feel like a bit of overkill, since the site is static and uses very minimal Javascript. 

The biggest thing I've learned was how to bring a design from thought to reality with Tailwind and HTML. The skills I taught myself before the site got brought to another level that I can use all the tailwind tools without having to check the documentation.

The next goal for me would be to learn thing that would make my websites more interesting. Such as animations or cool shapes that bring a site beyond the basic box layout.

It was particularly fun since I was able to go out to the customer's property back in the Cascades, and explore their quarry as well as meet their dogs.
