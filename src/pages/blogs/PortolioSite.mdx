Welcome to the part of the blog where I cataloge my progress on this very website. 
As I learn new frontend techniques, I typically impliment them here for practice.

This site was build using Astro JS framework and so far has been a joy to use. 
I picked it over the alternatives such as Next, Nuxt, and, SveltKit since it is focused on static content and can use a large variety of component libraries. 
Astro's island architecture is an excellent way to generate content with great preformance and still have responsive compoents.
