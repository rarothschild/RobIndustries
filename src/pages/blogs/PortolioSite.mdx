Welcome to the very first blog post. It's going to be very sparse and mostly serve as a placeholder right now. 

This site was built using the Astro framework, a newer tools used to create statics sites but also enables islands of interactivity. 
For example the blog post sorting uses JS to organize posts by tags or date. So far it has been very intuitive, aside from some temporary setbacks like image routing and hosting on GitHub Pages, it has become a very fun project.
